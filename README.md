## imjoy-rpc handshaking protocol

To start a connection between the core and an rpc peer (a plugin), a handshaking process is required to exchange the api. For the rpc peer, it works like a service provider that takes a set of api from the core and produce a set of service functions. The handshaking defines the exchange of interface functions, as well as authentication and configuration.

Here is a schema illustrate the process:

## Data type representation

ImJoy RPC is built on top of two-way transport layer(currently only support [Jupyter comm messages](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/comms.html)). Data with different types are encoded into a unified represention and send over the transport layer. It will then be decoded into the same or corresponding data type on the otherside.

The data representation is a JSON object (but can contain binary data, e.g. `ArrayBuffer` in JS or `bytes` in Python). The goal is to represent more complex data types with primitive types that are commonly supported by many programming language, including strings, numbers, boolean, bytes, list/array and dictionary/object.


| Javascript | Python | imjoy-rpc representation |
|------------|--------- | ---- |
| String   | str        | v |
| Number   | int/float | v |
| Boolean  |  bool     | v |
| null/undefined  | None    | v |
| ArrayBuffer | bytes  | v |
| Array([])   | list/tuple |[_encode(v)] |
| Object({})  | dict  | {_encode(v)} |
| Set | Set | {_rtype: "set", _rvalue: _encode(Array.from(v))} |
| Map | OrderedDict  |{_rtype: "orderedmap", _rvalue: _encode(Array.from(v))} |
| Error | Exception | { _rtype: "error", _rvalue: v.toString() } |
| Blob | BytesIO/StringIO  | { _rtype: "blob", _rvalue: v, _rmime: v.type } |
| DataView | memoryview  |  { _rtype: "memoryview", _rvalue: v.buffer }|
| TypedArray | 1-D numpy array*  |{_rtype: "typedarray", _rvalue: v.buffer, _rdtype: dtype} |
| tf.Tensor/nj.array | numpy array  |{_rtype: "ndarray", _rvalue: v.buffer, _rshape: shape, _rdtype: _dtype} |
| Function* | function/callable* | {_rtype: "interface", _rid: _rid, _rvalue: name} <br> {_rtype: "callback", _rvalue: id} |
| Class | class/dotdict()* | {...} |
| custom | custom | encoder(v) (default `_rtype` = encoder name) |

Notes:
 - `_encode(...)` in the imjoy-rpc representation means the type will be recursively encoded (decoded).
 - For any JS object or Python dictonary, if it has a key named `_rintf` and the value is set to true, then this object will be treated as an interface. All functions contained in the object/dictionary, including all the children dictionary at any level, will be treated as `interface` function. Otherwise, it will be encoded as `callback`. The difference is `interface` function can be called many times, but the `callback` function can only be called once (Also see "Remote Objects" below).
 - For n-D numpy array, there is no established n-D array library in javascript, the current behavior is, if there is `tf`(Tensorflow.js) detected, then it will be decoded into `tf.Tensor`. If `nj`(numjs) is detected, then it will be decoded into `nj.array`.
 - Typed array will be represented as numpy array if available, otherwise it will be converted to raw bytes.    
    Type Conversion
    | Javascript | Numpy  | _rdtype |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | Int8Array | int8 | int8 |
    | Int16Array| int16 |int16 |
    |  Int32Array| int32 | int32 |
    |  Uint8Array| uint8 | uint8 |
    |  Uint16Array| uint16 | uint16 |
    |  Uint32Array| uint32 | uint32 |
    |  Float32Array| float32 | float32 |
    |  Float64Array| float64 | float64 |
    |  Array| array | array |
    |note: 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned) are not supported|

 - `dotdict` in Python is a simple wrapper over `dict` that support using the dot notation to get item, similar to what you can do with Javascript object.

 ## Encoding and decoding custom objects
 For the data or object types that are not in the table above, for example, a custom class, you can support them by register your own `codec`(i.e. encoder and decoder) with `api.registerCodec()`.

 You need to provide a `name`, a `type`, `encoder` and `decoder` function. For example: in javascript, you can call `api.registerCodec({"name": "my_custom_codec", "type": MyClass, "encoder": (obj)=>{ ... return encoded;}, "decoder": (obj)=>{... return decoded;})`, or in Python you can do `api.registerCodec(name="my_custom_codec", type=MyClass, encoder=my_encoder_func, decoder=my_decoder_func)`.
 

 The basic idea of using a custom codec is to use the `encoder` to represent your custom data type into array/dictionary of primitive types (string, number etc.) such that they can be send via the transport layer of imjoy-rpc. Then use the `decoder` to reconstruct the object remotely based on the representation.

For the `name`, it will be assigned as `_rtype` for the data representation, therefore please be aware that you should not use a name that already used internally (see the table above), unless you want to overried the default encoding. Also note that you cannot overried the encoding of primitive types and functions.

The `encoder` function take an object as input and you need to return the represented object/dictionary. Note that, you can only use primitive types plus array/list and object/dict in the represented object. By default, if your returned object does not contain a key `_rtype`, the codec `name` will be used as `_rtype`. You can also assign a different `_rtype` name, that allows the conversion between different types.

The `decoder` function converts the encoded object into the actual object. It will only be called when the `_rtype` of an object matches the `name` of the codec.

### Example 1: encoding and decoding custom classes with imjoy-rpc
In this example, we first define a `Cat` class, then we register a codec to do encoding and decoding of the `Cat` instances.

```javascript
class Cat{
  constructor(name, color, age, clean){
    this.name = name
    this.color = color
    this.age = age
    this.clean = clean
  }
}

api.registerCodec({
    'name': 'cat', 
    'type': Cat, 
    'encoder': (obj)=>{
        // convert the Cat instance as a dictionary with all the properties
        return {name: obj.name, color: obj.color, age: obj.age, clean: obj.clean}
    },
    'decoder': (encoded_obj)=>{
        // recover the Cat instance
        return new Cat(encoded_obj.name, encoded_obj.color, encoded_obj.age, encoded_obj.clean)
    }
})

class Plugin {
    async setup(){
    }
})

class Plugin {
    async setup(){
    }
    async run(){
        const dirtyCat = new Cat('boboshu', 'mixed', 0.67, false)
        // assuming we have a shower plugin
        const showerPlugin = await api.getPlugin('catShower')
        // now pass a cat into the shower plugin, and we should get a clean cat, the name should be the same
        // note that the other plugin is running in another sandboxed iframe or in Python
        // because we have the cat codec registered, we can send the Cat object to the other plugin
        // Also notice that the other plugin should also define custom encoding decoding following the same representation
        const cleanCat = await showerPlugin.wash(dirtyCat)
        if(cleanCat.clean) api.alert(cleanCat.name + ' is clean.')
    }
};
api.export(new Plugin())
```

Note that, you need to implement the same encoding and decoding for the two connection peers. Otherwise the object will remain undecoded.

### Example 2: sending `itk.Image` from Python to Javascript

Here is another example for supporting a new type `itk.Image` for displaying 2D/3D image in Python in the itk-vtk-viewer (Javascript). 

We will first encode all the itk.Image instances with the `itkimage_to_json` function.

```python
# Run `pip install itk itkwidgets` before trying this example
from imjoy_rpc import api
import numpy as np
import itk
from itkwidgets.trait_types import itkimage_to_json, itkimage_from_json
from itkwidgets._transform_types import to_itk_image

# register an encoder for encoding the itk.Image, the name `itkimage` will be used for decoding
# this example only use the encoder part
api.registerCodec({'name': 'itkimage', 'type': itk.Image, 'encoder': itkimage_to_json, 'decoder': itkimage_from_json})

class ImJoyPlugin():
    def setup(self):
        api.log('plugin initialized')

    async def run(self, ctx):
        image_array = np.random.randint(0, 255, [10,10,10], dtype='uint8')
        itk_image = to_itk_image(image_array)
        # here the itk_image will be encoded via the registered encoder function (i.e.: itkimage_to_json)
        api.createWindow(type="itk-vtk-viewer", src="https://oeway.github.io/itk-vtk-viewer/", data={"image_array": itk_image})

api.export(ImJoyPlugin())
```

For the Javascript part, we also need a codec to decode the itkImage, we will use an existing function called `decompressImage`. Here is the implementation we made for the viewer served on https://oeway.github.io/itk-vtk-viewer/:

```javascript

// register a decoder to decode custom type `itkimage`
api.registerCodec({name: 'itkimage', decoder: itkVtkViewer.utils.decompressImage})

api.export({
    setup() {
        api.log("itk-vtk-viewer loaded successfully.")
    },
    async run(ctx) {
        await this.imshow(ctx.data.image_array)
    },
    async imshow(image_array) {
        // image_array is the decoded image
        const vtkImage = itkVtkViewer.utils.vtkITKHelper.convertItkToVtkImage(image_array)
        const dims = vtkImage.getDimensions()
        const is2D = dims.length === 2 || (dims.length === 3 && dims[2] === 1)
        itkVtkViewer.createViewer(container, {
            image: vtkImage,
            pointSets: null,
            geometries: null,
            use2D: is2D,
            rotate: false
        })
    }
})
```

## Remote Objects

When sending an object (a JS `Object`, `Class` or Python `dict`, `class`) remotely via imjoy-rpc, a proxy object will be created on the other side. The object can contain supported data types which will be send directly to remote locations.

Specifically for the methods contained in the object, there are two types of encoding modes (`interface` and `callback`). The difference is that a remote method encoded as `callback` can only be called once and will be destroyed after calling, and `interface` mode can be used without this limitation. 

The two types can be switched automatically or manually:
 * if the object contains a key or property: `_rintf` and the value is true, then all the member function will be treated as `interface` recursively.
 * if the object is not a basic `Object`/`array` or `dict`/`list` but other general class, then it will be treated as `interface`.

Note: if a method's name starts with `_`, it will not be sent and mapped remotely.

Importantly, When an object is sent to remote location, the object will be stored in an internal object store. Because the object store will always hold object, it will not be possible for the garbage collector to recycle the resources. To get rid of this issue, you need to dispose the remote object manually by calling `api.disposeObject(obj)` function. This will notify the remote peer to remove the object from the object store, such that the garbage collector can then collect the occupied resources.

**Therefore, please always call `api.disposeObject(obj)` when you don't need a remote object anymore.** This is necessary only for those object encoded in `interface` mode.
